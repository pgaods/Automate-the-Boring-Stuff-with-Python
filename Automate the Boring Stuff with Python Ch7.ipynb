    "We will be studying regular expressions in this lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a motivating example, you may be familiar with searching for texts by pressing CTRL-F and typing in the words you’re looking for. Regular expressions go one step further: They allow you to specify a pattern of text to search for. You may not know a business’s exact phone number, but if you live in the United States or Canada, you know it will be three digits, followed by a hyphen, and then four more digits (and optionally, a three-digit area code at the start). This is how you, as a human, know a phone number when you see it: 415-555-1234 is a phone number, but 4,155,551,234 is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are helpful, but not many non-programmers know about them even though most modern text editors and word processors, such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice, have find and find-and-replace features that can search based on regular expressions. Regular expressions are huge time-savers, not just for software users but also for programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we’ll learn more about what is an regular expression (a.k.a. regex) and apply them to pattern matching tasks. This chapter is very important because it lays the foundation for text mining and natural language processing. "

    "To start with, say we want to find a phone number in a string. You know the pattern: three numbers, a hyphen, three numbers, a hyphen, and four numbers. Here’s an example: 415-555-4242. Let’s create a function named isPhoneNumber() to check whether a string matches this pattern, returning either 'True' or 'False'. We can now use the function below to find phone number in a text string. This can be done by iteration in Python. On each iteration of the 'for' loop, a new 'chunk' of 12 characters from message is assigned to the variable 'chunk'. The loop goes through the entire string, testing each 12-character piece and printing any 'chunk' it finds that satisfies isPhoneNumber(). Once we’re done going through message, we print 'Done'. "

    "The previous phone number–finding program works fine, but it uses a lot of code to do something limited: the function  isPhoneNumber() is 17 lines but can find only one pattern of phone numbers. What about a phone number formatted like 415.555.4242 or (415) 555-4242? What if the phone number had an extension, like 415-555-4242 x99? The isPhoneNumber() function would fail to validate them. You could add yet more code for these additional patterns, but there is an easier way.\n",

    "Regular expressions, called 'regexes' for short, are descriptions for a pattern of text. For example, a \\d in a regex stands for a digit character — that is, any single numeral 0 to 9.

    "numbers, another hyphen, and four numbers. Any other string would not match the \\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d regex. Moreoever, regular expressions can be much more sophisticated. For example, adding a 3 in curly brackets {3} after a pattern is like saying, \"Match this pattern three times.\" So the slightly shorter regex \\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4} also matches the correct phone number format. In all, the benefit of using regular expressions is enormous, and it can handle a large amount of data in different forms. \n",

    "We now need to learn how to create regexes in Python. Most of the regex functions in Python are in the 're' module. Passing a string value representing your regular expression to re.compile() returns a regex pattern object (or simply, a regex object). There are many methods associated with a regex object. For example, a regex object’s search() method searches the string it is passed for any matches to the regex. The search() method will return 'None' if the regex pattern is not found in the string. However, if the pattern is found, the search() method returns a 'Match' object. This 'Match' object, just like other objects in Python, have many associated methods with it. For example, the 'Match' objects have a group() method that will return the actual matched text from the searched string. "
