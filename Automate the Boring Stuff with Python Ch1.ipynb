To start with, you will need to install the Python on your local computer together with the Jupyter notebook. Once this is done, you can find the 'exe' file to launch the Jupyter notebook. The exe file 'jupyter-notebook.exe' will help open a Jupyter notebook for Python and you are welcome to pin that file to the Windows 'Start' task bars. \n",

    "Lastly, we cover a special topic related to string escaping in this current lecture, which is often used in automation projects. The point of string escaping is to mask special characters and make special formats with strings. To begin with, string literals can be enclosed in matching single quotes (') or double quotes (\"). They can also be enclosed in matching groups of three single or double quotes (these are generally referred to as triple-quoted strings). The backslash character \"\\\" is used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character. String literals may optionally be prefixed with a letter 'r' or 'R'; such strings are called raw strings and use different rules for backslash escape sequences. "
