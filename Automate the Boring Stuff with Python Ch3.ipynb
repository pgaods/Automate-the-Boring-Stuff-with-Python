For example, there can be a local variable named 'spam' and a global variable also named 'spam'. This works exactly the same way as in SAS.

The idea of the 'try' and 'except' clauses are that when code in a 'try' clause causes an error, the program execution immediately moves to the code in the 'except' clause. After running that code, the execution continues as normal. This type of programming is more flexible then the if-elif type of statements because you don't have to specify each sub-cases when the program fails for different reasons. "
