    "Another important trick related to dictionaries is the setdefault() method. In many applications, you’ll often have to set a value in a dictionary for a certain key only if that key does not already have a value. In that case, you may need to use a 'if' statement to hardcode the value when it does not exist. The setdefault() method offers a way to do this in one line of code. The first argument passed to the method is the key to check for, and the second argument is the value to set at that key if the key does not exist. If the key does exist, the setdefault() method returns the key’s value. As an example below, the two sets of code achieve the same result. But the second example that uses the setdefault() method is more simple and elegant. Essentially, the setdefault() method is a nice shortcut to ensure that a key exists."
