    "This mini program in Python will help data scientists back up data and folders in a zip file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you’re working on a project whose files you keep in a folder. You’re worried about losing your work, so you’d like to create zip file snapshots of the entire folder. You’d like to keep different versions, so you want the zip file’s filename to increment each time it is made; for example, AlsPythonBook_1.zip, AlsPythonBook_2.zip, AlsPythonBook_3.zip, and so on. You could do this by hand, but it is rather annoying, and you might accidentally misnumber the zip files’ names. It would be much simpler to run a program that does this boring task for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the mini program is as follows: we first grab all the files that need to be zipped. Then we check to see if a folder exists which can be used to place the zip file. During the process, we also implement version control so that you can have many copies as you like. There are many ways to do version control. One simple way is to use the timestamp as a suffix for the filename. Each time we back up a set of files, the final zip file will contain the time_stamp information. "
