Consider the following tasks: 1) Making copies of all PDF files (and only the PDF files) in every subfolder of a folder. 2) Removing the leading zeros in the filenames for every file in a folder of hundreds of files named 'spam001.txt', 'spam002.tx', 'spam003.txt', and so on. 3) Compressing the contents of several folders into one ZIP file (which could be a simple backup system).

    "To create your own compressed zip files, you must open the 'ZipFile' object in write mode by passing 'w' as the second argument (this is similar to opening a text file in write mode by passing 'w' to the open() function). When you pass a path to the write() method of a 'ZipFile' object, Python will compress the file at that path and add it into the zip file. The write() method’s first argument is a string of the filename to add. The second argument is the compression type parameter, which tells the computer what algorithm it should use to compress the files. You can always just set this value to zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED (this specifies the deflate compression algorithm, which works well on all types of data):"
