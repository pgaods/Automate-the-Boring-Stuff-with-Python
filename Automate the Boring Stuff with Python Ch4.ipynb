    "A list is an object that contains multiple values in an ordered sequence. The term 'list' value refers to the list itself (which is a value that can be stored in a variable or passed to a function like any other value), not the values inside the list value. A list value looks like this: ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']. Just as string values are typed with quote characters to mark where the string begins and ends, a list begins with an opening square bracket and ends with a closing square bracket, \"[\" and \"]\". Values inside the list are also called items. Items are separated with commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in R, indexing is possible in Python for lists. However, the position always starts from 0. Negative signs means you are starting the position from the left to right. Python will give you an IndexError error message if you use an index that exceeds the number of values in your list value. In addition, the \"colon\" punctuation \":\" implies 'keep on going' (very similar to SAS). So this can also be used for indexing list too. Elements of lists can be of different data types. "

    "An important trick while using list is to know when to apply the empty list. For example, if the code needs more dynamic and interactive type of programming (such as utilizing the input() function to ask for user's input information), we can combine an empty list with a loop structure. As an example below, suppose we want to store the name of our cats. The program essentially uses a single list and stores any number of cats that the user types in. The benefit of using a list is that your data is now in a structure, so your program is much more flexible in processing the data than it would be with several repetitive variables.\n",
